\subsection{Question 4} Prove that:
\begin{enumerate}[(a), leftmargin=1cm]
	\item If \( T \) is a tree then \( |V(T)| = |E(T)| + 1 \).
	\item If \( F \) is a forest and \( c(F) \) is the number of components of \( F \), show that \( c(F) = |V(F)| - |E(F)| \).
\end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
For (a) we proceed by induction on \( |V(T)| \). If \( |V(T)| = 1 \) then \( T \) is edgeless so that \( |V(T)| = 0 + 1 = |E(T)| + 1 \). Now fix \( |V(T)| \geq 2 \).  Then \( T \) has at least one leaf \( v \). Let \( T' = T \setminus v \). Then \( T' \) is a tree on \( |V(T)| - 1 \) vertices, so by the IH we have \( |V(T')| = |E(T')| + 1 \). Appending \( v \) to \( T' \) gives one new vertex and one new edge. Hence \( |V(T)| = |V(T')| + 1 = |E(T')| + 1 + 1 = |E(T)| + 1 \) and we're done.

For (b) we induct on \( c(F) \). If \( c(F) = 1 \) then from (a) \[|V(F)| = |E(F)| + 1 \Leftrightarrow   1 = |V(F)| - |E(F)|. \] Then if \( c(F) \geq 2 \), let \( F' \) be obtained from \( F \) by deleting one entire component \( C \). Then by the IH we have \( c(F') = |V(F')| - |E(F')| \) and since \( C \) is a tree, (a) implies that \( |V(C)| = |E(C)| + 1  \). Putting these two together, we obtain that
\begin{align*}
	c(F) &= c(F') + 1 = |V(F')| - |E(F')| + |V(C)| - |E(C)| \\
	     &= |V(F)| - |E(F)|, 
\end{align*}
since \( V(F') \cap V(C) = E(F') \cap E(C) = \emptyset  \). This completes the proof.
\end{proof}
