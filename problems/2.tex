\subsection{Question 2}

Let \( F \) be a forest on \( n \) vertices. Prove that the intersection of \( k \) connected subgraphs of \( F \) is either empty or a tree.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
It suffices to prove the claim when \( k = 2 \), since given connected subgraphs \( C_1, C_2, \hdots , C_{k}  \), we have by induction that \(C = C_1 \cap \cdots \cap C_{k-1}  \) is either a tree or empty. If \( C \) is a tree then it is connected and we may apply the case when \( k = 2 \) to \( C \cap C_{k}  \). Otherwise \( C \) is empty so that \( C \cap C_{k}  \) is too. Thus, we just need to prove the base case now.

Let \( C_1, C_2 \) be two connected subgraphs of \( F \). If \( C_1 \cap C_2 \) is not empty, then there is a vertex \( v \) in their intersection. Thus \( C_1 \cap C_2 \) is connected. Since \( C_1 \cap C_2 \subseteq C_1 \) and \( C_1 \) is acyclic, so is \( C_1 \cap C_2 \). Hence \( C_1 \cap C_2 \) is a tree. If \( C_1 \cap C_2 \) is not a tree, then it is either not connected or contains a cycl. The latter case can not hold, since \( C_1 \cap C_2 \subseteq F \) is a forest.

If \( C_1 \cap C_2 \) is non-null, then it must be connected. Indeed, as before, there is a vertex \( v \) in \( C_1 \cap C_2 \). Then there is a path between the two components so that \( C_1 \cap C_2 \) must be connected. Applying the contrapositive, we obtain that \( C_1 \cap C_2 = \emptyset  \). 
\end{proof}
